# A detailed information about this project

0. Multiple mains  --  Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
1. Like, comment, subscribe -- Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. 0 > 972? --Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. Leap year -- Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.
